after create credentials  cut the credentials and put it in the terraform folder rename into "credentials.json"

add this in provider block
credentials = file("credentials.json") 

the block looks like this
provider "google" {
  project = var.project
  region = var.region
  credentials = file("credentials.json")  # Use this if you do not want to set env-var GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
}
